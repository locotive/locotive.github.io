## Plan

This is a focused plan to master Backend development over the winter break. Below is a roadmap that outlines the learning objectives and key phases. Each phase combines both theory and hands-on practice to maximize learning efficiency, diving deep into each topic.

## Laying the Foundations (Weeks 1-2)

**Key Topics:**

Understanding HTTP/HTTPS Protocols: Learn how client-server communication works, including HTTP status codes, headers, and cookies.
REST API: Understand what RESTful APIs are and how to design and use them.
Git & GitHub: Learn how to manage version control using Git, and practice collaboration by hosting a project on GitHub.

## Choosing a Backend Language and Basic Learning (Weeks 3-5)

**Key Topics:**

Choose a language like Python (Django) or Node.js (Express) and dive deep:

Start with basic syntax and gradually move to building a web server.
Create simple APIs and get familiar with sending and receiving data.
Introduction to Databases:

Compare SQL and NoSQL databases and their use cases.
Install and practice using MySQL or PostgreSQL.
Learn about NoSQL databases like MongoDB to broaden your understanding.

## Moving to Intermediate Backend Development (Weeks 6-8)

**Key Topics:**

Authentication and Authorization:

Implement authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
Learn about external authentication methods like OAuth2.
Asynchronous Processing and Message Queues:

Understand the concept of asynchronous task handling.
Learn how to use message queues such as RabbitMQ or Apache Kafka.

## Project-Based Learning (Weeks 9-12)

**Key Topics:**

Building a Full Project:

Use the knowledge gained to complete a full backend project.
Create a simple e-commerce site, blog, or TODO list API to get hands-on experience with real-world scenarios.
Deployment and Operations:

Learn containerization using Docker.
Deploy applications on AWS, Heroku, or DigitalOcean.
Set up CI/CD pipelines to automate testing and deployment.

## Optimization and Advanced Topics (Weeks 13-14)

**Key Topics:**

Application Performance Optimization:

Learn caching strategies (e.g., using Redis).
Optimize database queries and performance tuning.
Logging and Monitoring:

Set up logging and monitoring systems using the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or Prometheus with Grafana.

## Goal:

By the end of winter break, the goal is to follow these steps systematically to master all essential Backend skills and apply them through project work.
