## Plan
This is a focused plan to master Operating Systems (OS) concepts over the winter break. Below is a roadmap that outlines the learning objectives and key phases. Each phase combines both theory and hands-on practice to maximize learning efficiency and deepen understanding of OS principles.

## Laying the Foundations (Weeks 1-2)

**Key Topics:**

Introduction to Operating Systems: Understand the purpose and functions of an operating system, the role of the kernel, and different types of operating systems (e.g., batch, time-sharing, real-time).
Processes and Threads: Learn about process management, creation, termination, states, and scheduling. Understand the differences between processes and threads and the basics of context switching.
System Calls: Explore how user programs interact with the operating system through system calls.

## Process Synchronization and Deadlocks (Weeks 3-5)

**Key Topics:**

Concurrency and Synchronization: Understand the need for synchronization in multiprocessor systems. Learn about critical sections, mutual exclusion, and how to avoid race conditions using mechanisms like semaphores, mutexes, and monitors.
Deadlocks: Dive into deadlock detection, prevention, avoidance (e.g., Banker's algorithm), and recovery. Learn the four necessary conditions for a deadlock to occur.

## Memory Management (Weeks 6-8)

**Key Topics:**

Memory Hierarchy: Understand the organization of memory, including primary (RAM) and secondary memory (disk storage), and the role of cache.
Virtual Memory: Learn about paging, segmentation, and the concept of virtual memory. Understand how the OS manages memory through page tables and TLBs (Translation Lookaside Buffers).
Swapping and Paging: Explore how modern OSes handle memory swapping between physical RAM and disk storage using paging and segmentation.

## Storage, File Systems, and I/O Management (Weeks 9-12)

**Key Topics:**

File Systems: Learn about file organization, file system structures (e.g., FAT, NTFS, ext4), and how the OS manages file storage and retrieval.
Disk Scheduling: Understand how the OS schedules disk I/O operations (e.g., FCFS, SSTF, SCAN, C-SCAN algorithms) for performance optimization.
I/O Systems: Explore how the OS manages hardware devices, including device drivers, interrupts, and buffering.

## Advanced Topics and Security (Weeks 13-14)

**Key Topics:**

OS Security: Understand key OS security principles, including user authentication, access control mechanisms, and encryption.
Distributed Systems: Learn about distributed operating systems, client-server models, and synchronization in distributed environments.
Virtualization: Explore the concepts of virtual machines (VMs) and hypervisors, and understand how virtualization allows multiple operating systems to run on a single hardware platform.

## Goal:

By the end of winter break, you will have a solid understanding of how operating systems work, from process management to memory and storage management, with insights into advanced topics like security and virtualization. This knowledge will be useful for both academic purposes and real-world applications in system programming.
