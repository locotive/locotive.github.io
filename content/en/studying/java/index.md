## Plan

This is a focused plan to master Java over the winter break. Below is a roadmap that outlines the learning objectives and key phases. Each phase combines both theory and hands-on practice to maximize learning efficiency and deepen understanding of Java.

## Laying the Foundations (Weeks 1-2) ##

**Key Topics:**

Basic Syntax: Understand the structure of Java programs, data types, operators, and control flow (loops, conditionals).
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Dive deep into OOP concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.
Java Collections: Learn the usage of arrays, lists, sets, maps, and queues.

## Core Java Programming (Weeks 3-5)

**Key Topics:**

Exception Handling: Learn about Java's exception hierarchy, try-catch blocks, and custom exceptions.
File I/O: Get familiar with reading from and writing to files in Java using streams and readers.
Concurrency: Understand multithreading in Java, including creating threads, synchronizing them, and using the java.util.concurrent package.
## Moving to Intermediate Java (Weeks 6-8)

**Key Topics:**

Generics: Learn how to write flexible and reusable code using Java generics.
Lambdas and Streams: Explore functional programming in Java through lambda expressions and the Stream API for efficient data manipulation.
Annotations and Reflection: Understand how annotations work and how to use reflection for dynamic code analysis.
## Project-Based Learning (Weeks 9-12)

**Key Topics:**

Building Java Applications: Apply your knowledge to build a complete project, such as a console-based library management system or an address book application.
JavaFX: Create simple graphical user interfaces (GUIs) using JavaFX for a more interactive project.
Maven/Gradle: Learn how to manage dependencies and build automation using Maven or Gradle.

## Advanced Java and Optimization (Weeks 13-14)

**Key Topics:**

JVM Tuning and Optimization: Learn how to tune the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) for better performance, including garbage collection strategies.
Memory Management: Understand Javaâ€™s memory model, heap and stack memory, and memory leaks.
Testing: Learn about testing frameworks like JUnit and Mockito to write unit tests and mock objects.

## Goal:
By the end of winter break, you will have gained a strong grasp of Java programming, including core and advanced concepts, and applied them through project-based learning.
