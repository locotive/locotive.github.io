This project aims to develop a web platform where users can explore and view a curated Google Map of popular photo spots. In addition to providing location details, the platform will also offer important information for photographers, such as weather conditions and light pollution maps. By integrating these key factors, the platform will help photographers easily find the best locations and optimal times to capture stunning images.
